"@FutFrustrados @MLB @RedSox Defendere a Trout con tu mismo argumento mediocre \"aún no acaba su carrera, no sabes cuántos premios más va a ganar\" aunado a esos 5 bats de plata, a esos 2 MVP, esos 6 juegos de estrellas y ese novato del año"
"@FutFrustrados @MLB @RedSox Si, hay quien tiene más contacto (Altuve), más poder (Davis), más velocidad (varios), mejor guante, (betts), mejor brazo (Puig) pero es la suma de todo eso lo que lo hace ser mejor que todos ellos. Es el estar constante en cada categoría lo que lo vuelve lo que es para el deporte"
"@FutFrustrados @MLB @RedSox En ese caso, las victorias son la estadística más importante para un pitcher, solo porque es la estadística de toda la vida. Si notas lo pendejo que me miró diciendo eso?"
"@FutFrustrados @MLB @RedSox No entiendo que es lo difícil de admitirlo, el tipo es mejor incluso que leyendas, estará al final de su carrera con los números de Pujols y jugando una posición de mayor valor."
"@FutFrustrados @MLB @RedSox Y si esas no te satisfacen, las de las últimas 5 temporadas tal vez lo hagan. Cómo puedes ver, las estadísticas no mienten y lo único que tiene betts que Trout no es ese anillo que se gana en EQUIPO. https://t.co/h7g1PEYttV"
"@FutFrustrados @MLB @RedSox Si, entiendo y el mejor bateador de todos los tiempos TED WILLIAMS, Ty Cobb el promedio más alto en la historia, Gwinn el único de los 50' para acá en batear .390 no están entre los mejores de la historia porque su equipo nunca ganó serie mundial. Si sabes lo que estás diciendo?"
"@FutFrustrados @MLB @RedSox Los títulos se ganan en equipo, pero los números individuales están y en cada categoría que mencionaste Trout esta en top 5 eso lo vuelve el jugador más completo, ergo, el mejor jugador."
"@FutFrustrados @MLB @RedSox Jaja entiende, lo de el equipo a clasificar no depende de un jugador, vamos leyendas como Ted Williams, Ty Cobb, Griffey Jr, Ichiro o Gwynn nunca ganaron una serie mundial y si pones en duda de que todos fueron los mejores en sus respectivas épocas estás bien pendejo."
"@FutFrustrados @MLB @RedSox O otro caso es el de Khris Davis que según tu lógica no sería jugador de élite porque no batea más de .250 \"cómo va a ser de los mejores si falla en 3 de cada cuatro turnos\" aunque su slg y su ops siempre están en top, pero esas no sirven, solo sirve el AVG."
"@FutFrustrados @MLB @RedSox Jaja ahora el que está targiversando eres tú, el war el ops y el slugging son estadísticas que toman en cuenta todas las otras estadísticas. Nada que ver con tu comparativa de los dribles contra los puntos."
