"@SirJerrytime @Zach83758528 @_noltre_ @RyanMickens7 You say that because I’m a uva fan and your hokies beat uva. Yet factually you’re as clueless as most uva football fans. Again, have fun beating uva. Because history shows that’s all you really can do"

"@Zach83758528 @SirJerrytime @_noltre_ @RyanMickens7 Lol. The issue with your 100% guarantee is that if Vt wins it’s a narrative. Same old same ol. But if VT loses, you’ll fall to depths you never imagined possible for your mediocre football program. And you’ll have nothing left to hope on"
"@SirJerrytime @_noltre_ @Zach83758528 @RyanMickens7 VT football is better. I’m not denying that. As far as current? I find it’s getting harder to determine who is better. Your two Acc wins were while the Acc was down, but doesn’t take away the titles. Yet, all you have a streak over uva. GT can say more than VT"
"@SirJerrytime @Zach83758528 @_noltre_ @RyanMickens7 You obviously can’t read. Said earlier VT has the better program. Since Welsh was wrongly pushed out UVa has fallen well off the map in football while Vt surpassed them easily. The national narrative however, Vt crumbles"
