"@TheBigStick4 @yannAl_ @nbastats @NBA They beat them this last time because they lost Paul George on defense, it had ZERO to do with how they defended Harden. You're a joke. I'm done, good night."
"@TheBigStick4 @yannAl_ @nbastats @NBA Lol. Clearly you watched like 5 Rockets games. That is literally the TEAMS style of play, CP3 does them same thing, its called Diantoni's system, Steve Nash did the same thing. ISO drive kick to open 3s. \"Leads the team in assist, but doesn't play team ball\" OK bud."
"@TheBigStick4 @yannAl_ @nbastats @NBA Also come on man. You're stretching numbers. Harden plays 4 more minutes not 6. In the NBA 2 mins is a big deal. And they both make 10 shots per game and Harden still has way more ppg."

Means he is very VALUABLE to his team. But if you shut down Giannis the Bucks can still win. Means he isn't as valuable. TY!"
"@TheBigStick4 @yannAl_ @nbastats @NBA Dude I'm done, you're not even being realistic. Attempting 2.8 and making 0.7 threes per game is not actually shooting threes. Also you do know getting fouled doesn't count as a shot attempt or missed shot."

"@MoreezeP @JordanHandsDown @ZeroDarkTwenty3 @NBA_Math @NBATV right. it's showing total points added over the course of the season. so you're seeing what Giannis did in 2,358 minutes played this season and what Harden did in 2,867 minutes played this season."
"@sturridgexp @22jaredc @NBA_Math Harden had 100 more points added/saved than Giannis this season. he needed to play 500 more minutes than Giannis to do it. if you know how to read the chart, it tells you that Giannis averaged more points added/saved per minute than Harden did this year."

Russell:
25.2 points
4.3 rebounds

"@mrjuIianscott @TeeMustafa @DaRealDom15 @Biddissc20BC @BR_NBA They're not. Siakam making that jump in 12.4 more minutes is what's suppose to happen. DLo is averaging huge numbers while only playing 4.7 more minutes than last year"

"@mrjuIianscott @TeeMustafa @DaRealDom15 @Biddissc20BC @BR_NBA You're basically trying to argue that Siakam's stats jump but try to ignore that Russell's stats jump.
