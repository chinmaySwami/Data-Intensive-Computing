"@WittyNameHere88 Which is SUPER SAD. There could ALSO be a marketing change that can spike prestige levels of this tournament that can give it a big enough importance so that MLS looks outward a little bit more and not just inward."
"@LicCarrera1 First off, they DID NOT reach a final. They lost 10-2 in a semifinal. I don’t care who you are, who you played, that’s embarrassing for an MLS club. Secondly, we need triumphant mentalities in MLS to grow accountability for big clubs falling on big stages. Like ATL, like SKC"
"@LicCarrera1 Well, this is a tournament well MLS should be winning. If it’s one season where an MLS doesn’t reach the final or doesn’t win...ok. But that’s not the case. It’s year after year of coming up short in CCL"
"I've been having GREAT discussions with my followers about what another devastating MLS loss at the international level means for the league and if there will ever be change (or not) because of these (in)significant games.

Thanks to everyone for your thoughts! <U+0001F44A><U+0001F44A><U+0001F44A>"
"10-2 on aggregate seems like a fair, historic representation of Liga MX vs MLS in the #CCL"

"@mahonri12 I'm not the only one that should be asking for change. Other journalists, other fans...the MLS soccer landscape must speak in order to feel represented.

@GlennCrooks @arieljudas @jrojasa75 @tkolker"
"@JuanG_Arango @UnivisionSports @MLS The owners that don’t want to spend are the problem. 
Your eyes don’t lie, MTY’s quality up and down the line doesn’t exist in #MLS, and by the way, nor in the majority of Mexico either. 
Mexico’s elite have a huge class difference. It shows..."
"@JuanG_Arango @UnivisionSports @MLS Jorge Berry made a good point saying that this series isn’t probably the difference between the leagues, that they are closer, but maybe it is between the top teams on either side. Maybe it was matchup problem. Either way it doesn’t look good. And it’s not good..."
"When is @mls loosening the salary cap? 
How much more evidence do  @thesoccerdon and the owners need to see regarding the difference between #MLS and the best of #LigaMX.
#MLS just got spanked publicly. 
#SKCvMTY #SCCL2019 10-2."
"@jllevin79 @MLS And you don't have to pick one way, (academy or buying talent), there is nothing from stopping anyone from doing both except personal ambition of ownership. And when they increase the cap, they have to bring up the floor too. No Donald Sterlings wanted or needed."
"@ESPNDep1050AM @MLS @NYCFC @ESPNFutbolClub A las 3pm platicaremos con mis compañeros de @ZonaEspn_NY sobre #NYCFC y los playoffs de la #NBA @ESPNDep1050AM y el App de #ESPN.

"@ciossa101 @JuanG_Arango @SportingKC @MLS And yet, the knee jerk reaction by some in Mexico and Hispanic media here is that he should be fired for this. Because of zero accountability and pressure in #MLS. #SCCL2019 
@SportingKC"
"@JuanG_Arango @UnivisionSports @MLS I might have a bone to pick with some of their analysis. Enrique Borja had to correct the panel regarding young players. The “European” calendar argument is garbage. They just postponed a game THIS week! 
The salary cap IS the handicap..."
"@JuanG_Arango @UnivisionSports @MLS After this year, if #MLS bounces back and somehow wins it, a lot of people will consider it a fluke, not catching up. That’s how damaging this semifinal was. Five goals against twice is hard to argue against.
@MLS has to accelerate its growth. It’s needs results, not lip service."
"@ciossa101 @JuanG_Arango @SportingKC It's hard to understand why #SKC looked so poor defensively. Maybe it was a bad match up, that happens. I don't think the difference between #LigaMX &amp; #MLS is 10-2, but this year it's obvious that @MLS did not progress from last year, and the top of MEX did. #MLS must improve."
"@alejandroberry Y esa es parte de la ventaja de ser DT acá. No tienes que estar impresionando a los medios por temor a lo que digan de ti. Los dueños no se arrebatan con cada resultado. Dejan trabajar, hay un plan. 90% de Rayados serían Jugadores Designados en la #MLS. A #SKC le permiten 3."
"Is @mls really going to do something about this aside from lip service?
The salary cap is now limiting #MLS potential, it is no longer helping it grow. The league is financially strong and stable, loosen the reigns. 
#SCCL2019 https://t.co/Gc46TJ6Gnm"
"@bunnyptfc I saw. It was 12°F at game time. Inhumane conditions for sure. On second thought they said they should have postponed it. And about a few hundred people showed up. 
How does THAT grow the game? 
#MLS also at fault for scheduling a home game there in early March."
"@jllevin79 @MLS Agree with all of this. You can still keep the field level with a salary cap, albeit, a much higher one. You can't compete with #LigaMX under these conditions. The evidence is clear. I hope that the owners that want to get better and spend make some real noise."
"@buciochr Creo que este año hay estancamiento de la #MLS en comparación. En años anteriores se veía crecimiento. Pero @Rayados demostró ser totalmente superior. El marcador es fiel reflejo. 
La @futbolMLS tiene que reflexionar y cambiar. Esto no es aceptable. El tope salarial los mata."

And none of the leagues you mentioned keep the clubs afloat with tons of free money."
"@mrfangmeier @mumbleblade @AlexiLalas @allianzfield @MLS @MNUFC Maybe in other places where clubs aren't propped up by the league indefinitely. In MLS higher ticket prices mean more straight into the owners pockets that the club will never see."
"@Vicrdev1 @BudFullCal @SeanSteffen @MLS 100% irrelevant comment. 

MLS fans and teams are the ones bitching about being in preseason for the CCL and for having to play without star players during international break weeks. Not following the FIFA calander is the exact reason for both."
"@mrfangmeier @AlexiLalas @allianzfield @MLS @MNUFC Typical MLS, everything has to be fudged. Build the stadium extra small so it'll always look full. 

And if 2018 averaged almost 24k people how is a stadium with a Max of 25k growth? That's basically zero room for growth."
"@AlexiLalas @allianzfield @MLS @MNUFC All of that and it's barely bigger than Talen."

"@mrfangmeier @mumbleblade @AlexiLalas @allianzfield @MLS @MNUFC Even at 22k, it's currently smaller than that, with planned capacity to only slightly exceed that.

No room for growth. Clearly not planning on the fanbase growing in the future."
"@mumbleblade @mrfangmeier @AlexiLalas @allianzfield @MLS @MNUFC Nah. Rather not spend any time or money supporting garber shills. 

You clearly don't have a justification for defending such a small capacity in relation to current numbers so you just deflect and avoid. 

What it says is the team doesn't expect more than 2k new fans long term."
"@mumbleblade @mrfangmeier @AlexiLalas @allianzfield @MLS @MNUFC Why not stay on topic? We're talking about MLS. 

They built a stadium with 4k less seats than their average attendance because they didn't want to do an environmental impact study, and the long term Max capacity is only 1k higher than that 2018 average."
"@BudFullCal @SeanSteffen @MLS If they followed the FIFA calander like the rest of the world this wouldn't happen."
"@mrfangmeier @AlexiLalas @allianzfield @MLS @MNUFC 25k is still a very low number. And considering how long it's been I really don't think another year is a deal breaker."
"@mrfangmeier @mumbleblade @AlexiLalas @allianzfield @MLS @MNUFC So already there's a 2k deficit in seats. Right now as of day 1. Ok. So then there's more demand and they expand and there will still be a deficit of seats and oh guess what no more room for expansion."

"@PaulTenorio @pragidealist29 @blharreld @MattDoyle76 @away_goals again, I'll grant you his previous success, but before his move to MLS he'd played fewer first team minutes in 2019 than Sargent, in a lesser league. Rewarding him for stepping down further, and punishing Sargent for competing at a club chasing Europa League, is insanity."
"@PaulTenorio @pragidealist29 @blharreld @MattDoyle76 @away_goals because we have real-life examples of players who weren't getting many minutes in other leagues, who came to MLS and suddenly looked good. Carlos Vela is the prime example. Russell Canouse. Darwin Quintero, even. Kenny Saief and Kekuta Manneh more recently."
"@PaulTenorio @pragidealist29 @blharreld @MattDoyle76 @away_goals Hope you're right. Sargent was better than Saief for the USMNT in 2018, and I don't think it was close. The only narrative I'm (consciously) espousing is that starting in MLS shouldn't automatically move a player ahead of one who isn't starting in a better league."
"I've seen a lot about how MLS needs to compete with LigaMX and catch up to them. I'd prefer that MLS and US Soccer work on growing the game here and get our structure in order. It's going to be impossible to catch a league that's been around much longer than MLS."
"@Efried97 The end of MLS parity is probably great news for Atlanta fans"
"How MLS can close that gap isn't a secret: Spend more money. Simple, right?"
"It's been said a million times, I'll say it again: Before MLS can even begin to think about arriving where it wants to as a league, it has to close the very real gap with a steadily improving Liga MX."
"@OgtheDim you do remember that I was talking about \"top\" Liga MX teams and \"top\" MLS teams?"
"Of course not!

Getting to the point where series between top MLS teams and top Liga MX teams are true toss-ups (not one-off upsets, never 10-2 blowouts) requires money to be spent in a way that would probably kill parity and require a drastic re-working of MLS roster rules."
"In 2008-09, the Puerto Rico Islanders did better in CONCACAF Champions League than all but three MLS teams have in the history of the competition."
"There's certainly less parity than before. but the gap between the best and worst MLS teams isn't that significant. Look at D.C. United from the start of 2018 to now.

Competing in CCL would require further shifting away from that. https://t.co/hZDDdRI35B"
"One other thing: Spending gap or no, 10-2 is a ridiculous score in a semifinal. Ridiculous. And Sporting KC might be the best run organization in MLS."
"@Adnan7631 The initial tweet was slightly tongue in cheek. Only three teams have done better than them. That’s the point. Maybe I should’ve phrased it that way. It’s not a great look in terms of MLS’ record in this comp."

"@FranciscoEfV @GolazodelGringo I mean, the answer is 'both' unless you're doing something wrong. MLS' top teams wouldn't be able to beat the top Argentine sides in Libertadores either but Almiron still goes to the PL direct on the strength of his time with Atlanta not with Lanus."

"@VgnGamer12 @herculezg @MLS @SebiSalazarFUT @ESPNFC I'm saying Herc was being lazy and using only surface level numbers to prove a point which we all know is not true. 24 year old Vela who bottom fed in 13/14 next to Griezmann is not better than 30 year old experienced Vela. If Vela was in Liga MX you think he has this take?"
"@VgnGamer12 @herculezg @MLS @SebiSalazarFUT @ESPNFC There is no doubt he was good at Sociedad, but since he has lost himself. So, I guess my point is that he has rediscovered himself and has learned from the past couple years. Now, at 30, he is a more complete player and I wouldn't let the league he is playing in take that away."
"@VgnGamer12 @herculezg @MLS @SebiSalazarFUT @ESPNFC 1 Assist in those 14 games if you were wondering as well. The stats look nice at the surface level, but lets be honest... Vela wasn't contributing against the best in La Liga. Hardly a season that us unbeatable just because of the league."
"@TotalSoccerShow @SouthSoundShane Exactly. If you don't give your best young talent opportunities, why should they stick around? I see plenty of teenagers who play in the Premier League and La Liga, but when it comes to MLS they are looked at as not good enough."
"@herculezg @MLS @SebiSalazarFUT @ESPNFC ok Herc. So Vela's last 3 season in La Liga of 16 goals in 92 apps was better? He gained his confidence back in MLS. Maybe he isn't quite at his best ever, but it is the best he has been in 5 years."
"@VgnGamer12 @herculezg @MLS @SebiSalazarFUT @ESPNFC Wasn't going to get into all this, but since Herc decided to get smart a retweet, I had to do his job for him and actually present the statistics of his impeccable season."
"@VgnGamer12 @herculezg @MLS @SebiSalazarFUT @ESPNFC So yes, I don't think he was his best in 2013/2014. I feel like he would score in bigger games if you dropped him in there right now and I don't feel like that is much of a hot take."
"@VgnGamer12 @herculezg @MLS @SebiSalazarFUT @ESPNFC Having to go 6 years back (half a player's career) says it all. Herc may not realize this, but the season he is alluding to (2013/2014) saw Vela fail to score vs any of the top 8 teams in the league! 0 goals against top 8 teams! One is Sociedad so that's 14 games! Unbelievable"
"@VgnGamer12 @herculezg @MLS @SebiSalazarFUT @ESPNFC It will be difficult to keep this pace up, because right now it is ridiculous (7g &amp; 4a in 6 games). That is why I was so surprised Herc dismissed it so easily. Hence the reason I wanted to remind him that it was against lower La Liga teams (much more comparable to MLS than Barca)"
"@VgnGamer12 @herculezg @MLS @SebiSalazarFUT @ESPNFC I'd certainly say La Liga lower teams are better than MLS, although many rip it for being weak at the bottom. The point of the matter is Herc was making him out to be a top player that year, but the numbers certainly fail to support that."

"@TJ_Heath @ZeroCool138 @RiotSquadcast You already have the haves and have nots in mls. But you aren’t going to have a 2 team league with a salary cap. I’m not advocating for taking that away. But a team who can work within the salary restrictions and bring these players in, more power to them."
