transfer another player cash onetime fee actual salary called wages dont think always released also something called financial fair play means rich owner cant cut check player spend money comes via revenue clearly favores large clubs like manutd city liverpool arsenal chelsea know dont care soccer media talking clue equate transfer fees salary completely wrong inaccurate one thing like mlb seems

successful way back done well recent hicks ownership yes hicks texas rangers basically screwed bad anfield play despite large stadium k quite outdated big clubs expanded beyond k much modern rumblings liverpool moving theyve announced committed upgrading existing stadium sound familiar fenway  anfield argument another car garage alive well argument moving money one also none thought drive fans nuts sides eventually wind killing fans media da sports sunday said great plan hype fenway  happy raise tickets sell bricks collect pay matter well team brought dichotomy around collapse response something like tell jack welsh cant run one business clubs might businesses cant run like pure businesses passionate fans eventually reject treated like product see mean liverpool like red sox theyre spending

liverpool expenditures paid mostly obscene amounts money big epl teams get tv revenue theres rights pool thats shared among teams premiership team gets paid based specific games televised sponsorship revenue actual gate probably least revenue streams although still quite significant especially teams like man u arsenal titanic kk capacity stadia rich team like liverpool owners putting per year thats keep team solvent insolvent teams actually penalized points standings  prevent teams debtfinancing massive expenditures players hopes theyll recoup funds via higher placement league rarely works usually drives team receivership fsgliverpool talk really grinds gears people complaining heyman et al make clear blatantly know nothing business epl finances work likelike latetodinner says february
