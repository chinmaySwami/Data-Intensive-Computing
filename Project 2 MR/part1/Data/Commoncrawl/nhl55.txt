vintage audio  popular posts ian turnbull aggravating enigmatic  talented poor  season leafs one thing look forward held three draft choices first round  maple leafs understand player development let first make obvious statement im simply longtime hockey observer analyst dont pretend able break whats next leaf shoe drop think something brewing likely possibilities funny things appear quiet leafville probably tend make assumption whole lot going oh  leaf legacy lifetime part iv ouch drawing close sometimes almost always bombastic occasionally controversial leaf owner harold ballard decided  michaels new ebook canadian residents us residents canadian residents us residents joe colborne fit sunday july  ive trying wade pros cons somewhat polarized opinions vlm moves dave nonis made since offseason began leafville sure roster makeover continues many believe leafs better overall shape heading next season moves still come quality goaltending depth oomph front hasten add universal view feels like prevailing oneat least feels clear least mind nonis far finished filling canvas exactly blank begin tweaking cases much tweaking continues nothing else shown afraid make moves sentimental attachment many players argue however exactly gm sees bozak whether organizations desire retain kessel part behind decision resign young center discussion another day trying figure good enough center ice position yes bit different grabovski bolland picture go battle next season three centers year ago kadri bozak mcclement lineup middle leaf fandom complained quite regularly lacked true numberone center life still dont see one roster argued possible dont need one given allaround skill set pivots ill even set notion aside today though next question kind tie muchheralded joe colborne colborne arrived one great young hopes burke era acquired former high pick bruins little along development curve simply acquired future draft pick certain extent knew getting wasis young player size though physically imposing center ice man serious injuries seemed neutralize progress healthy particularly latter stages past season showed something wont pretend seen play often provide detailed analysis brings doesnt saw player jump times sees ice well make plays great skater much fine im sure much finisher physical forward enough time something sometimes catches eye good enough carlyle utilize key moments playoffs boston coach saw something colborne injuries created opening ive often said hockey world full guys potential really good minorleague players show well brief period time bigleague level enough sustain career dont know colborne fits guy shown potential guess real question among see colborne important part leaf future fit bozak bolland kadri safely assume resign long mcclement already established become winger spot opens trade bait ive watched colborne time toronto marlies primarily could shake dustin penner comparison penner guy two stanley cup winners insubstantial part success teams lot career marred skating circles syndrome player always leaves wanting looks less determined much time said big talented guy marvelous times playoffs recognize comparisons usually empty futile rarely even remotely close accurate im acknowledging one pops mind think young leaf future idea colborne anywhere near ceiling penner demonstrated best given play injuries fairly suggest fact lazy player penner often described biggest question future blue white guess let know  pm labels joe colborne comments pete cam july   pm believe things stand either mcclement colborne second winger line bolland kuleman fourth line centre played wing believe would good job either role also gives us spare centre bigteam case injury read interest j ash calgarys comment yesterdays blog basically said maybe leafs need classic  centre present centres cover needs brilliant observation makes perfect sense think get caught someones blueprint nhl team must  centre type described blog must top six bottom six leafs dont big  centre therefore non lousy job even taking consideration defense needs think  season phil kessel joffery lupul averaged point game playing tyler bozak would achieved playing ideal centre open conjecture personally think also  centre would command  would weaken us elsewhere cap presents enormous difficulties gms leafs signing remaining rfas see trade near future cant see addition defense given cap situation ideally would nice add piece pretty happy weve got given fransons emergence gardiners return form playoffs healthy gunnarsson answer question think healthy joe colborne definite asset next season grow role solid nhl forward replydelete replies reply michael langlois july   pm could right pete cam wonder colborne secondline player im fan centers playing wing like kadri thought background center one right way construct team thats true also true firstline centres awfully expensive million may near enough thanks pete cam replydelete replies reply intimefor july   remember fine young centreman prospect early recently saw youtube clips forgotten put time wing room centre young man turned franchise player even wasnt obvious would become played wing young darryl sittler didnt grab attention likes keon ullman mix however see slower progression may require patience wait young joe grow frame still reportedly increasing last year colborne strikes guy gonna glad waited hes already persevered wrist serious finger injury getting better every season think may see rd line wing th centre filling injured centremen wherever needed may start season ahl surprised doesnt extended look year hope wait may special c hoping though im willing anoint anything hope point  maybe doesnt need c anyway impressed j ashs comments yesterday think nonis asking players buy team concept may create middle class cap usage projected new cba expectations ive read distinct upper echelon separated salary rest team may grabovskis contract illustration problem worth got bought even hes great player lowerappropriate salary replydelete replies michael langlois july   yes colborne worth watching intimefor hard know ceiling big guys sometimes takes always think back phil espositonot particularly physical big rangy center nice player chicago orr boston superstar late youre right grabovski unlikely us would questioned value making million season delete replies reply reply leafdreamer july   also wonder colborne one pennertype players may lazy talented always seems leave wanting said tyler biggs way havent seen flashes brilliance yet ive paid close attention either ok time got big club definitely hasnt shown like frattin kadri deserves shot big club scoring role im actually little worried may end depend one pivots gets injured makes comfortable however must say im sure development experts carlyle watching closely give chance deserves im sure comes prepared camp shows play big boys carlyle hesitate demote move wing another guy doesnt one thing like noniscarlyle approach willingness play players showing workethic talent demotetrade awaylet walk arent take wild guess  think joe start season bollands wing expected play role checker sort like kulemin orr last year  get thrown learn defensively responsible  know  keep puck oppositions end strong boards throw hit every well may get chance centre maybe even kessel knows hand turns mediocrity bad work ethic doesnt carlyle tells doubt hell quickly traded whatever get replydelete replies michael langlois july   two distinct possibilities leafdreamer player agree coach openminded lots guys got shot last season guys year delete replies reply reply bcapp july   would like play ona fourth line sheltered scoring line top everyone expects followed mcclementbollandkulemin shutdown third line carlyle insists putting fighters means wouldnt get offensive opportunity fourth line replydelete replies michael langlois july   guess things could change midseptember bcapp might affect deployed playing orr maclaren mentioned wouldnt give chance show offensive skills thanks chiming well see plays delete replies reply reply tmlfan july   colborne interesting question year especially light age majority time spent ahl sufficient opportunity really show might able nhl level hes played regular season nhl games scattered seasons averaging mins per game games closer mins ice time playing th line ive always someone likes see player given opportunity guys like kadri gardiner spent time back ahl get development showing indeed nhl players id like see colborne given similar chance show though depth center despite lack true  makes difficult joe find ice time center may stuck rd th line wing mind injury center deck shuffled colborne could potentially get chance mind mcclement probably play lot th line center could occasionally flip rd line think carlyle want keep rested available pk unit opt play joe th line center doubt get see much offensively especially maclaren  orr wingers looking  mins game th line even rd line limited offensive zone time start im hoping colborne gets put rd line wing bolland kulemin may even wishful think might use sometimes center consider sliding bolland wing suppose really depends colborne camp prepared fight fulltime roster position needs impress carlyle rest coaching staff guys like ashton  damigo hungry try win spot well like colbornes potential upside im hoping sticks team gets chance play quality minutes replydelete replies michael langlois july   may indeed situation training camp mean something tmlfan colborne shows healthy great shape plays hard may make carlyle find place big club guess however regression see back marlies much like frattin make leafs minitraining camp past january remember correctly delete replies reply reply dp july   think ease colborne nhl third fourth line season colborne play wing college problem mcclement play wing third center fourth line guess colborne play softer teams sit tough guy fraser mclaren teams done past season playing well could see colborne third line minutes leafs wont really hurt colbornes development limited minutes bottom  colborne got lots development time ahl  seasons near point never colborne actually good defensive player never heard coach either eakins carlyle complain defensive game goals scored ice fit well carlyle could even see year speedy jerry damigo gets look faster soft teams bottom six might look like kulemin bolland mcclement damigo colborne orr againt tough teams could kulemin bolland mcclement mclaren colborne orr kulemin bolland colborne mclarenmcclement orr replydelete replies michael langlois july   pm always prefer centers play natural position see lineup working colborne wing necessary dp id like see damigo fits toohe seems lot jump game delete replies reply dp july   pm id like see damigo fits one interesting story lines season best talents marlies young thus waiver exempt could sit mclaren soft teams could injury able give audition sorts marlies season damigo ashton leivo biggs brollmckegg abbott scott delete replies reply reply jim july   pm michael hope time joe colborne doesnt fit leafs dont see much role big club look hes marginal player best third fourth line duty cannot fathom supposed develop number one two centre league getting minutes game line two guys best described hockey terms face punchers apologies orr mclaren noted abilities thats colbornes development would best served mind playing big minutes prominent role marlies maybe maybe making clear team could trade centres team get another asset desperately need prominent defenseman prospect like gardiner perhaps disheartening leaf fans always us forget best player team long term lets get lineup soon way years bitch moan lack development already read rielly may crack lineup year never ends leafland constantly rush players nhl run town hello luke schenn sorry career path cant wait thing colborne rielly schenn colborne lineup opening night tell things management team first tells given colborne becoming number one two centre nhl second nonis unable make moves improve forward position third team continues best term ignoring long term progress organization leafs much better served opinion trying emulate new jersey model players learn takes minors prove think get shot role big club nonis go get bargain basement veteran fill role checking winger leafs anything else im afraid replydelete replies reply michael langlois july   pm think know jim im fan rushing young players ive written subject extensively often referring back days jack valiquette later jim benning others long issue toronto im neither big fan colborne someone thinks cant play really dont know im putting question fans see feel said instance plenty time minors players dont need three seasons ahl going make impact player exceptions course guess well find colborne ultimately fits thanks jim replydelete replies dp july   pm rule thumb says player getting near point game ahl ussually ready nhl colborne three seasons ahl last year points games year close think reduce expectations highly doubt colborne ever number one center think peaks number good defensive game looking comparibles think michal handzuš  lbs good  points peak years number one center useful guy could play good teams playoff games playoff points delete replies reply michael langlois july   pm let add dp think natural fans certain expectations guy firstround draft pick know always translate nhl success doubt part reason lofty expectations lets honest guys like dudley really promoted fans want believe hype organization natural thanks dp delete replies reply jim july   pm guess make point little clearly would nice really wanted say third line wingers dime dozen nhl team doesnt feel colborne upside outside role fine saying feel another season ahl may prove capable something isnt going happen playing wing alongside facepunchers nhl team sees way try trade team believes upside allowing sign completely replaceable tim brent joey crabb type player potential left playing colton orr isnt going allow colborne prosper delete replies reply dp july   pm jim another thing consider fourth line might change andor get better face punchers might change different success young guy like tyler biggs plays good defensive game tough better hockey player us junior gold medal team could mean end mclaren leaf similarly think david broll also tough could better hockey player take colton orrs slot shortterm low salaries mclaren andor orr easily waived thinking biggs broll could become tough guys actually play hockey like shawn thorton ryanne clowe watch develop marlies year delete replies reply reply dan july   pm saw lot colborne marlies much time nagging injuries keep mind reading comments saw tall frame played soft terms lack physical play compete level dont understand height someone hasnt told add lbs  lbs gives high centre gravity enough strength battle puck anyway people talking high ceiling star status  youre dreaming first round draft pick implications selection hes undoubtedly bust career nhler though think alexei ponikarovsky rather dustin penner think carlyle would demand hopefully get physical play needed replydelete replies michael langlois july   pm assessment might sound harsh dan seen offbase far gets stronger adds weight becomse physical presence maybe higher ceiling delete replies reply reply anonymous july   pm think give colborne chance play year  long hes willing sign
